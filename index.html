      <h1>María de los Ángeles Robles</h1>
      <h2>Lv. 29 - Psychic</h2>
      <p>The rare and elusive Maria emerges from her lair only when it comes time to feed and has never been sighted in the same place twice (except that she attends Le Wagon almost everyday -__-). Ever moving, this noble creature is only frequented by those lucky enough to prove themselves worthy of her presence to know where to find her next. She evades those she wishes not know of her whereabouts, and would rather avoid confrontation than create it.<br>
      Though many have attempted to catch this elusive being, no single trainer has been able to claim ownership. She remains wild and to some, still a figment of the imagination. This legendary creature is quiet yet powerful. If not careful, you might not even know she is there until it's too late.<br>
      Maria is fond of delicious home-cooked pies, small meaningful trinkets, and good movies.</p>

              <p>While protecting his village from rampaging boar-god/demon, a confident young warrior, Ashitaka, is stricken by a deadly curse. To save his life, he must journey to the forests of the west. Once there, he's embroiled in a fierce campaign that humans were waging on the forest. The ambitious Lady Eboshi and her loyal clan use their guns against the gods of the forest and a brave young woman, Princess Mononoke, who was raised by a wolf-god. Ashitaka sees the good in both sides and tries to stem the flood of blood. This is met by animosity by both sides as they each see him as supporting the enemy.</p>
